# Emery Scott - Professional Portfolio

This is the official source code for my acting, modeling, and voice-over portfolio website.

## Project Overview
This site is a single-page responsive portfolio designed to showcase my reels, resume, and gallery. It uses a "Soft Summer/Autumn" color palette to reflect my personal brand aesthetic.

## Features
- **Hero Section:** Introduction and downloadable resume/comp card.
- **Portfolio Tabs:** JavaScript-enabled tabs to switch between Acting, Modeling, and VO without reloading the page.
- **Live Gallery:** Masonry-style photo grid.
- **BTS Section:** Behind-the-scenes carousel.
